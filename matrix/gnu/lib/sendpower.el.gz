;; Provides a nice interface to evaluating Emacs Lisp expressions.
;; Input is handled by the comint package, and output is passed

(defcustom isend-power-prompt-read-only t
  "If non-nil, the Isend-power prompt is read only.
The read only region includes the newline before the prompt.
Setting this variable does not affect existing Isend-power runs.
This works by setting the buffer-local value of `comint-prompt-read-only'.
Setting that value directly affects new prompts in the current buffer.

If this option is enabled, then the safe way to temporarily
override the read-only-ness of Isend-power prompts is to call
`comint-kill-whole-line' or `comint-kill-region' with no
narrowing in effect.  This way you will be certain that none of
the remaining prompts will be accidentally messed up.  You may
wish to put something like the following in your init file:

\(add-hook \\='isend-power-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
             (define-key isend-power-map \"\\C-w\" \\='comint-kill-region)
             (define-key isend-power-map [C-S-backspace]
               \\='comint-kill-whole-line)))

If you set `comint-prompt-read-only' to t, you might wish to use
`comint-mode-hook' and `comint-mode-map' instead of
`isend-power-mode-hook' and `isend-power-map'.  That will affect all comint
buffers, including Isend-power buffers.  If you sometimes use Isend-power on
text-only terminals or with `emacs -nw', you might wish to use
another binding for `comint-kill-whole-line'."

differs only in text properties from the old one, Isend-power will no
longer recognize the old prompts.  However, executing \\[isend-power]

;;; Major mode

(define-derived-mode inferior-emacs-lisp-mode comint-mode "Isend-power"
  "Major mode for interactively evaluating Emacs Lisp expressions.
Uses the interface provided by `comint-mode' (which see).

* \\<isend-power-map>\\[isend-power-send-input] evaluates the sexp following the prompt.  There must be at most
  one top level sexp per prompt.

* \\[isend-power-return] inserts a newline and indents, or evaluates a
  complete expression (but see variable `isend-power-dynamic-return').
  Inputs longer than one line are moved to the line following the
  prompt (but see variable `isend-power-dynamic-multiline-inputs').

* \\[isend-power-return-for-effect] works like `isend-power-return', except
  that it doesn't print the result of evaluating the input.  This
  functionality is useful when forms would generate voluminous
  output.

* \\[completion-at-point] completes Lisp symbols (or filenames, within strings),
  or indents the line if there is nothing to complete.

The current working buffer may be changed (with a call to `set-buffer',
or with \\[isend-power-change-working-buffer]), and its value is preserved between successive
evaluations.  In this way, expressions may be evaluated in a different
buffer than the *isend-power* buffer.  By default, its name is shown on the
mode line; you can always display it with \\[isend-power-print-working-buffer], or the buffer itself
with \\[isend-power-display-working-buffer].

During evaluations, the values of the variables `*', `**', and `***'
are the results of the previous, second previous and third previous
evaluations respectively.  If the working buffer is another Isend-power
buffer, then the values in the working buffer are used.  The variables
`*1', `*2' and `*3', yield the process buffer values.

If, at the start of evaluation, `standard-output' is t (the
default), `standard-output' is set to a special function that
causes output to be directed to the isend-power buffer.
`standard-output' is restored after evaluation unless explicitly
set to a different value during evaluation.  You can use (princ
VALUE) or (pp VALUE) to write to the isend-power buffer.

The behavior of Isend-power may be customized with the following variables:
* To stop beeping on debug-files, set `isend-power-noisy' to nil.
* If you don't like the prompt, you can change it by setting `isend-power-prompt'.
* If you do not like that the prompt is (by default) read-only, set
  `isend-power-prompt-read-only' to nil.
* Set `isend-power-dynamic-return' to nil for bindings like `lisp-interaction-mode'.
* Entry to this mode runs `comint-mode-hook' and `isend-power-mode-hook'
 (in that order).

Customized bindings may be defined in `isend-power-map', which currently contains:
\\{isend-power-map}"
